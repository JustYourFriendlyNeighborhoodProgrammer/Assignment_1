 and each line contains 10 integers) from a file into an array and
 perform the following functions:

1. Check if a certain integer exists in the array if the number is present return

2. A function that can modify the value of an integer when called with the index
 of the integer in the array and return the new value and old value back to the user.

3. A function that adds a new integer to the end of the array.

4. A function which intakes an index of an array and remove
 the integer corresponding to that index.


Submission guidelines:

1)	You should have a header file and .cpp file.
 The header file should provide the function declaration
 and .cpp file should have implementation details.

2)	All the functionality of the program should be implemented as functions and methods.

3)	The code should be well commented.

4)	Create a report (readme file) that contains 
 instruction on how to run the code and screen shots of the outputs

5)	Upload your report and code files to GitHub.

6)	Submit the GitHub link on Canvas by due date.
