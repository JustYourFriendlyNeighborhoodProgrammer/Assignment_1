# Assignment_3

1)	 Write a new queue function called move_to_rear that moves the element currently at the front of the queue to the rear of the queue. The element that was second in line will be the new front element. Do these using functions push, front, and pop.



2)	As discussed in Chapter 5, a palindrome is a word that reads the same left to right as
right to left. Write a recursive function that determines whether its argument string is a
palindrome.



3)	Draw an expression tree corresponding to each of the following:

    a)	Inorder traversal is:  x / y + 3 * b / c 
    
    b)	Postorder traversal is:  x y z + a b – c * / –
    
    c)	Preorder traversal is:  * + a – x y / c d 



4)	The to_string method generates a string representing a preorder traversal in which each local root is on a separate line. If a subtree is empty, the string "NULL" is displayed. Considered the output of a to_string method below and  show the tree that would be built by the following data lines. Is the resulting tree a binary search tree, a full tree, and/or a complete tree?

5)	Declare the map container stateDataMap to store pairs of the form (stateName, capitalName), where stateName and capitalName are variables of type string: 
•	Write C++ statements that add the following pairs to stateDataMap: (Nebraska, Lincoln), (New York, Albany), (Ohio, Columbus), (California, Sacramento), (Massachusetts, Boston), and (Texas, Austin). 
•	Write a C++ method that outputs the data stored in stateDataMap. 
•	Write a C++ statement that changes the capital of California to Los Angeles 
•	Write a C++ method that outputs the capitalName using the stateName which will be entered by the user. 



Submission guidelines: 
1.	For Question 3 and 4 provide the text document that has the respective tree and answers to any questions asked. 

For the rest of the questions: 

2.	You should have a header file and .cpp file. The header file should provide the function declaration and .cpp file should have implementation details.

2.	All the functionality of the program should be implemented as functions and methods. 
3.	The code should be well commented 

4.	Create a report (readme file) that contains instruction on how to run the code and screen shots of the outputs. 

5.	Upload your report and code files to GitHub. 

6.	Submit the GitHub link on Canvas by due date.
