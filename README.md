Write a C++ program that can read data (letâ€™s say file that has 10 lines,
 and each line contains 10 integers) from a file into an array and
 perform the following functions:

1. Check if a certain integer exists in the array if the number is present return 
 the index where the number is present. 

2. A function that can modify the value of an integer when called with the index
 of the integer in the array and return the new value and old value back to the user.

3. A function that adds a new integer to the end of the array.

4. A function which intakes an index of an array and remove
 the integer corresponding to that index.
